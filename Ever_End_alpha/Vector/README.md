Some operations might be unusual/ambiguous/incorrect. If they are incorrect by mathematical standards, I would love a correction (with cited source). Any other operations are added for utility (any suggestions on how they could work better are also welcome).

# Usage

```lua
local vec = require("Vector")
local myVec = vec(1, 1)
local zeroVec = vec()
```
